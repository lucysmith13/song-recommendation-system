# Weekly Targets - Song Recommendation System

## Week 1:
### Progress Summary:
I have created the basic UI with Tkinter, user authorization with the Spotify Web API.
There are multiple frames which have different features for the recommendations. I have created 2 different algorithms for recommendations.
One is genre-based using the Last.fm API and the other is user-listening-history based.
There is also a random album picker from the user's saved spotify library.
### Targets:
- Fix error where user-based recs aren't displaying in UI
- Add drop-down menus for user entries for validation and accessbility
- Create at least 1 more new complex recommendation algorithm
- Add / fix scrollbar errors on listboxes
- Add the add to playlist feature in the UI
